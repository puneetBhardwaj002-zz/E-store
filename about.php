                    <p style="text-align: justify;">E-store is an Indian electronic commerce company with headquarters in Washington. It is the 
                        largest internet-based retailer in the India. E-store started as an online blog, but 
                        soon diversified, selling mobile phones. E-store also sells certain low-end products like USB
                        cables and other accessories.E-store has separate retail websites for India, the United States, the United Kingdom
                        and Ireland, France, Canada, Germany, Italy, Spain, Netherlands, Australia, Brazil, Japan, China, and Mexico. 
                        E-store also offers international shipping to certain other countries for some of its products.
                        In 2016, Dutch, Polish, and Turkish language versions of the German E-store websites were launched. In 2015,
                        E-store surpassed Walmart as the most valuable retailer in the India by market capitalization. E-store
                        is the fourth most valuable public company in the world, the largest Internet company by revenue in the world
                        and the eighth largest employer in the India. In 2017, E-store announced their plans to acquire Whole
                        Electronic Market for $13.4 billion by the end of the year, vastly increasing E-store's presence as a physical
                        retailer. The acquisition was interpreted as a direct attempt to challenge Walmart as a physical store.

                    <h3>OUR HISTORY</h3>
                    <p style="color:blue;">1998-</p>
                    <p style=" text-align: justify;">The company was founded in 1998, spurred by what E-store founder Velos called his "regret minimization framework," 
                        which described his efforts to fend off any regrets for not participating sooner in the Internet business
                        boom during that time. In 1998, Velos left his employment as vice-president of D. E. Shaw & Co., a Wall Street firm
                        and moved to Seattle. He began to work on a business plan for what would eventually become E-store.</p>

                        On October 11, 2016, E-store announced plans to build convenience stores and develop curbside pickup locations for phones. 
                        In December 2016, the E-store Go store was opened to E-store employees in Seattle. The store uses a variety of sensors and
                        automatically charges a shopper's E-store account as they walk out of the store, therefore there are no checkout lines.
                        The store is planned to open for the general public in early 2017.
